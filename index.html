COFFEE SHOPS - ANN ARBOR  

<p>Hi everyone! My name is Halle Michael and I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan. 
Coming from a coffee lover, I decided to go on a little tour throughout Ann Arbor and visit some local spots that I've never tried!
Hyperion Coffee Co, Comet Coffee, and Vertex Coffee were the three places that I checked out and gave ratings to. 
I chose these three places because they are easily accessible since they are on campus.
At each shop, I documented my experience and even made a short video montage!</p>


<p>For each shop, I will touch on different aspects that led me to the final rating.
I took into account the taste, price, environment, staff and other factors.
Explore this website if you love coffee and are interested in finding new places.</p>
